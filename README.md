# HousePricesAdvanceRegressionTechniques

The main aim of this project is to predict the house price based on various features

Following the below lifecycle for this project

1. Data Analaysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature Scaling
4. Model Training and Testing
5. Baseline Model for submission

Quick summary:
I started by collecting clean data and explored it to find useful trends. I then improved the data to make my models work better. After splitting the data into training and test sets, I tested several models and used cross-validation to make sure they were reliable. Finally, I made predictions and got good results on Kaggle!  I'm still working on this project to see if I can improve the results even more, possibly by using a weighted model combination
